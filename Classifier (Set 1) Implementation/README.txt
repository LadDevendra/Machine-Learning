Instructions to Run the Program:

1) you will get R code in Step-4 > Part A > Assignment 2.R 

2) R code has All the library dependencies that are required in the 1st section

3) “DATA and processing” is there in second section.

4) After that there is code for Each classifier With its best parameters and 80:20 Train/Test data split.

5) So once you run through Data and processing section, you can select the code for each classifier and just run it.

6) It will give you five values out of which best value is selected for the experiment tables and result report.


 STEP-4 > part D Folder

1) The final table for all classifiers with their best attributes and respective accuracies for different data splits

2) Logs for the same experiment are reported in the same folder.
