Project Contents: 
	1. Report, should be in root directory and clearly labeled.
	2. Code directory - Contains Ipython/Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb), the Python version of this file (.py), the textile of the code to be run on with the cheat checker program (.txt), and an html version of our project. This allows one to view the code exactly as it looks in the Jupyter notebook (except) you won’t be able to actually run the code in the .html file.
	4. Data directory - Contains all the training and testing datasets used in this project. 
	

Dependencies:

	Python3 (Not Python2!) - This is the latest and greatest version of Python and should be adopted by all users and lovers of Python. 

	sklearn: Python machine learning library - used for machine learning classification models, testing and training dataset spits, and analysis and evaluation metrics used in this project.
        pandas: Python data analysis library - used to create data frames and operate on the data in an efficient and tabular format. 
	numpy: Python matrix and numerical computation library - used for efficient numerical computation on data structures used in this project. 
	matplotlib: Python visualization library - used for some visualizations created for this project.
        seaborn: Python visualization library - used for data distribution visualization.
        biokit: Python visualization library - used for feature correlation visualization.
	Ipython: Python interactive shell environment - used to operate on data in a sandboxed cells. 
	Jupyter Notebook: Python browser-based IDE - environment all of the code was written in.

	To install an external package/library:
           It is recommended that you use the Python package installer called pip. For most version3 of Python3, pip is pre-installed. If it isn’t pre-installed with your version of Python, then Google will be your friend depending on the OS you are using. If pip is already installed on your system, then to install a package (as you will need to to use the dependencies listed above), run the following command:

		pip3 install package-name 


How to run:

		To run this program, you should simply be able to run the following command:

		python3 CS6375.001-SemesterProject.py

		This program was written using the Jupyter Notebook IDE. In this environment, code is written and run in individual sandboxed cells that can be run one at a time. If you run into issues with mutated data, it might be because the code is being run synchronously. It is recommended to run the code in a jupiter notebook environment.
